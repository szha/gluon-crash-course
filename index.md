# A 60-minute Gluon Crash Course

This crash course aims to provide a quick overview of how to use Gluon, the imperative interface of MXNet.

When you finish this Gluon crash course, you will have accomplished the following goals:

1. Understanding the basic usage of the major components of Gluon
2. How to train a a basic neural network to predict images


## Prerequisites
This course assumes that readers have basic knowledge about machine learning and neural networks.

For a high-level introduction to neural networks, you might find Andrew Ng's [Coursera class on Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning) useful for acquiring the basic neural networking knowledge.

You can also refer to these
[excellent hands-on tutorials](http://gluon.mxnet.io/) to learn deep learning from scratch.

Some of the material might stray a little too far into advanced mathematics, but don't be concerned. You can still learn to use neural networks and Gluon without a PhD.

## Setup
For instructions on running the Jupyter notebooks included with this course, please refer to the [README](README.md). Otherwise, you can simply read through this course's material.
