# Create a neural network

Now let's look how to create neural networks in Gluon. We first import the neural network `nn` package from `gluon`.

```{.python .input  n=1}
from mxnet import nd
from mxnet.gluon import nn
```

## Create a layer

Now create a dense layer with 2 output units.

```{.python .input  n=2}
layer = nn.Dense(2)
layer
```

Then initialize its weights with the default initialization method, which draws random values uniformly from $[-0.7, -0.7]$

```{.python .input  n=3}
layer.initialize()
```

We create a $(3,4)$ shape random input `x` and feed into the layer to compute the output. This is often called a forward pass in neural network.

```{.python .input  n=4}
x = nd.random.uniform(-1,1,(3,4))
layer(x)
```

As can be seen, we got a $(3,2)$ shape output. Note that we didn't specify the input size of `layer` before (though we can specify it with the argument `in_units=4` here), the system will automatically infer it during the first time we feed in data, create and initialize the weights. So we can access the weight after the first forward pass:

```{.python .input  n=5}
layer.weight.data()
```

## Chain layers into a neural network 

Let's first consider a simple case that a neural network is a chain of layers. During the forward pass, we run layers sequentially one-by-one. The following codes implement a famous network called [LeNet](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/lenet/) through `nn.Sequential`.

```{.python .input}
net = nn.Sequential()
# Creating layers in a name scope to assign each layer a unique
# name so we can load/save their parameters later.
with net.name_scope():
    # Add a sequence of layers. 
    net.add(
        # Simliar to Dense, no necessary to specify the input 
        # channels by the argument `in_channels`, which will be 
        # automatically inferred in the first forward pass. Also,
        # we apply a relu activation on the output. 
        #
        # In additional, we can use a tuple to specify a 
        # non-square kernel size, such as `kernel_size=(2,4)`
        nn.Conv2D(channels=6, kernel_size=5, activation='relu'),
        # One can also use a tuple to specify non-symmetric 
        # pool and stide sizes
        nn.MaxPool2D(pool_size=2, strides=2),
        nn.Conv2D(channels=16, kernel_size=3, activation='relu'),
        nn.MaxPool2D(pool_size=2, strides=2),
        # flattern the 4-D input into 2-D with shape 
        # `(x.shape[0], x.size/x.shape[0])` so that it can be used
        # by the following dense layers
        nn.Flatten(),        
        nn.Dense(120, activation="relu"),
        nn.Dense(84, activation="relu"),
        nn.Dense(10)
    )
net
```

The usage of `nn.Sequential` is similar to `nn.Dense`. In fact, both of them are subclasses of `nn.Block`. The following codes show how to initialize the weights and run the forward pass. 

```{.python .input}
net.initialize()
# Input shape is (batch_size, RGB_channels, height, width)
x = nd.random.uniform(shape=(4,1,28,28))
y = net(x)
y.shape
```

We can use `[]` to index a particular layer. For example, 
access the first convolution layer's weight and first dense layer's bias.

```{.python .input}
(net[0].weight.data().shape, net[5].bias.data().shape)
```

## Create a neural network flexibly

In `nn.Sequential`, MXNet will automatically construct the forward function that sequentially executes added layers.  
Now let's introduce another way to construct a network with flexible forward function. 

To do it, we create a subclass of `nn.Block` and implement two methods:

- `__init__` create the layers
- `forward` define the forward function.

```{.python .input  n=6}
class MixMLP(nn.Block):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        # Run `nn.Block`'s init method
        super(MixMLP, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        with self.name_scope():
            self.blk = nn.Sequential()
            # Already within a name scope, no need to create
            # another scope.
            self.blk.add(
                nn.Dense(3, activation='relu'),
                nn.Dense(4, activation='relu')
            )
            self.dense = nn.Dense(5)
    def forward(self, x):
        y = nd.relu(self.blk(x))
        print(y)
        return self.dense(y)

net = MixMLP()
net
```

In the sequential chaining approach, we can only add instances with `nn.Block` as the base class and then run them in a forward pass. In this example, we used `print` to get the intermediate results and `nd.relu` to apply relu activation. So this approach provides a more flexible way to define the forward function. 

The usage of `net` is similar as before.

```{.python .input}
net.initialize()
x = nd.random.uniform(shape=(2,2))
net(x)
```

Finally, let's access a particular layer's weight
